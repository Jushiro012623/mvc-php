# PHP MVC Project

Welcome to my PHP MVC project! This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and provides a simple structure for developing web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP (7.x or higher)
- Composer (for dependency management)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jushiro012623/mvc-php.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
3. Update Composer dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    composer update
## Usage
1. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally using a PHP built-in server or configure it with your web server.
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>/public
    
    php -S localhost:<port> 
## Key Points:
- The step to run `composer update` **immediately after cloning** the repository is emphasized.
- This ensures that users know they need to update the Composer dependencies before proceeding.
